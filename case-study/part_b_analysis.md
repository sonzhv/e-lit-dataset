# Case Study: *c-ya-laterrrr* by Dan Hett

## Object Overview
*c-ya-laterrrr* is a hypertext game created by Dan Hett in 2017 using Twine and HTML5. Hosted on the digital distribution platform itch.io, it is accessed through a web browser without installation. 

The work is based on Hett's personal experience of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, exploring themes of grief, choice, and trauma through interactive fiction. In this context, "the text" encompasses not only the written narrative passages but also the branching choice architecture, hyperlinks, visual layout, and the reader/player's selected path through the narrative. The work explicitly includes content warnings as part of its textual fabric, making the paratextual elements integral to the experience.

## Textual Model and Medium
The story is non-linear, which means it doesn’t go in a straight line. Instead, it branches into different directions based on your choices. It’s also highly interactive: you must click to continue, and your decisions change what happens next.

The interface is simple: you read a short passage, then choose from clickable links to go forward. This turns reading into doing. You don’t just follow the story, but you help build it through your choices. This makes you think and feel more deeply about the themes of grief and chance.

## Narratology
The story uses some clear storytelling tools:

**Narrative voice**: Sometimes it talks to “you,” sometimes it feels like someone’s private thoughts.

**Narrative time**: The story jumps around in time, replaying moments and exploring “what-if” versions of events, like how we rethink things after a trauma.

**Focalization**: You see everything through the main character’s feelings. The writing and choices make you share their confusion, sadness, or hope.

**Segmentation**: Some parts are short and urgent; others are longer and more thoughtful. How fast you click changes how the story feels.

These tools fit well here because the story is emotional, personal, and built around your participation.

## Quantitative Glimpse
The story has about 40 “pages” (called passages) and around 12 big choices. Some passages are very short, others longer. This mix creates a stop-and-go rhythm that feels like real thinking. It’s hard to study all the text at once, though, because every reader’s path is different.

## Short Concluding Reflection
This story lets you feel what the character feels by making you choose. It turns reading into an active, emotional experience. But that also means you can’t just skim it, you have to pay attention and participate.

If we treated this like a printed book, we would lose what makes it special: the weight of your choices, the “what-if” structure, and the way clicking through the story makes the emotions real. This isn’t just a story you read, it’s a story you live through, and that’s only possible because it’s digital.
